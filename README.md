# pynams
Interpret [FTIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform_infrared_spectroscopy) profiles with emphasis on water in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs)

* Create consistent baselines for groups of FTIR spectra
* Determine and plot integrated areas across profiles
* Estimate water concentrations
* Handle peak-specific data
* Model diffusion in 1D and 3D
